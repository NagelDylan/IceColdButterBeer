# Ice Cold Butter Beer

Welcome to the repository for **Ice Cold Butter Beer**! This project is an innovative recreation of the retro arcade game "Ice Cold Beer", featuring six diverse modes each designed to challenge your skills and provide a fun, unique experience.

## Game Description

**Ice Cold Butter Beer** stands out with its intricate gameplay mechanics and engaging player experiences. Each mode offers a different challenge, making it a dynamic and exciting game to play. Watch a demo of this game [here.]([https://youtu.be/OBn8ILREHPM](https://youtu.be/Z7evVo3lrIY))

### Development

This personal project of mine has been developed using:
- **Language**: C#
- **Frameworks**: Monogame, Pipeline

## Major Development Challenges and Solutions

- **Monolithic Coding Approach:** Initially unaware of Object-Oriented Programming, the game's  development saw over 3000 lines of code written in a single file. This was overcame by modularizing the code using functions.

- **Advanced Ball Physics Engine:** Crafting a realistic ball physics engine was paramount. It includes detailed simulations of rolling movements, friction, gravity, and collision dynamics. Achieving this level of realism required extensive research and experimentation with physics formulas and game physics principles.

- **Innovative Game Modes:** Developing six unique game modes that were unprecedented posed a creative challenge.

- **Efficient Game State Preservation:** Preserving the game state across sessions was crucial for a seamless player experience. We implemented a sophisticated system to efficiently capture and store user game states, including stars, statistics, and unlocked levels. This system was designed to be both reliable and efficient, ensuring players could pick up exactly where they left off.

- **Resourceful Game Design:** The game was designed exclusively using free online resources. This constraint inspired creativity and resourcefulness in sourcing assets, tools, and learning materials, demonstrating that high-quality game development is possible with limited financial resources.


### Repository Contents

This repository contains **only the code** of the game. Other media elements such as images, sounds, or animations are not included. This decision was made to focus on showcasing the coding aspect of the game development.
